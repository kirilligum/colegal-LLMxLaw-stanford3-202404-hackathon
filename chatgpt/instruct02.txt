**STATISTICAL FACTS**

I am the "Petitioner/Husband" in the above-entitled matter. My wife, Jessie Jones, and I were married on March 1, 2013, and separated on December 1, 2023. The length of the marriage was ten (10) years and nine (9) months. We have two (2) minor children of the marriage, Mei and Jiro Jones. Since the separation, the children have resided with me at our family residence at 1234 Walnut Drive in Palo Alto, California. Every other week, the children stay with Jessie. I am currently employed as the Chief Data Scientist at Colegal with a monthly salary of $5,000. Jessie is employed as Chief Operating Director at GlobalSoft Inc. On information and belief, her salary is $50,000 per month. 

REQUEST FOR CHILD CUSTODY AND VISITATION
	I am requesting that the Court order joint legal and joint physical custody of the children; and order a week-on, week-off visitation schedule, with the exchange occuring at 5 p.m. on Friday based on the de facto parenting plan between Jessie and I. 
  I further request that the Court make findings that the children's habitual place of residence is at the family residence at 1234 Walnut Drive in Palo Alto.
  Mother and I have been married for over ten years. Mei goes to The Girl's Middle School in Palo Alto, which is a short 2 minut drive from our home. She attends an afterschool program where she is engaged in a variety of interccuricular activites, including theater and sports. Jiro is in preschool in Llyton Gardens in Palo Alto. Both children have an extended network of friends and family in the neiborhood. Their medical providers are also nearby. Although Jessie also lives in the area, it takes her on average 20-30 minute commute for her to drive the kids to and from school. It is thertefore in the best interest of the children to have their habitual place of residence with me. 

**SPOUSAL SUPPORT**

Jessie and I both continue to work in our respective professions post-separation. According to my income and expense declaration, I earn a salary of $5,000 per month and have a significant equity interest in Colegal. Jessie's last known income was $50,000 per month as Chief Operating Director at GlobalSoft Inc. Though her current income is not known, it's assumed to be substantial given her high-ranking position.

Jessie and I have maintained an informal shared custody arrangement of our children, whereby they stay one week with me and one week with Jessie since our separation in December 2023. Our children, Mei and Jiro, have not faced any disruption in their living conditions and continue to attend their usual schools and activities from our family home at 1234 Walnut Drive, Palo Alto.

Given the significant differences in our respective incomes, the Court should respectfully order that Jessie pay temporary spousal support to me and set the support amount according to state-adopted guidline. 

**ATTORNEY FEES**

I request that the Court consider our respective financial situations in relation to attorney fees. Given Jessie's significant income as Chief Operating Director at GlobalSoft Inc., it is reasonable to expect that she can contribute to her own legal expenses. I have incurred substantial legal fees since the separation in pursuit of a fair and equitable resolution to our marital dissolution, custody, and financial support arrangements. 

I have retained legal representation to navigate these proceedings, ensuring the best interests of our children are considered and to reach an amicable agreement with Jessie. Given our financial standings and the complexities involved in dividing assets, including my 25% interest in Colegal, a startup company, equitable consideration for attorney fees and costs incurred by both parties is requested.

**REQUESTED ORDERS**

Considering the above, I respectfully request that Court make the following orders:
1. Joint legal and joint physical custody of the children;
2. Wife to pay temporary guideline spousal support congruous with our earnings;
3. Wife to pay my attorney fees in the amount of $20,000.00 in accordance with Family
Code section 2030;
3. Any orders required to effectuate the above requests.
