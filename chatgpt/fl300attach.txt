your job is to fill in "ATTACHMENT TO FL-300 REOUEST FOR ORDER AND TO FL-158 SUPPORTING DECLARATION FOR ATTORNEY FEES" section

here is an example of the section:
```
STATISTICAL FACTS
am the "Respondent/Wife" in the above-entitled matter.
1,
he "Petitioner/Husband,"
and I were married on
and
xxx
separated on
The length of the marriage was thirty-two (32) years and five (5)
onths. We have two (2) adult children of the marriage. The children, Husband and I share our
xxxxxx
family residence at
in Martinez, California. Husband and I have lived in
separate rooms since the separation. Husband is years old, and I am years old.
SPOUSAL SUPPORT
Husband and I are retired. We each have filed our respective Preliminary Declarations of
isclosure. According to Husband's declaration, he receives $7,342 per month in retirement pl
enefits from CalPERS, and $2,343 per month in Social Security benefits, for a total amount of
$9,685 per month.
Throughout the marriage, Husband managed his own finances and maintained separate
ank accounts. I owned and managed a small ice-cream business until 2013. After I stopped
orking, I dedicated my life to raising the children, being the homemaker, and supporting
usband's career advancement.
Husband and I have had an informal agreement in place that he pay mortgage, home
insurance, and real estate taxes, and I pay utilities, phone, and various household bills. My
hildren and I also buy groceries for the house, and I pay all of my auto expenses, including gas,
surance, and maintenance.
My current income consists of Social Security benefits in the amount of $786 per month.
do not have a retirement or a pension plan. In December of 2021, I had to take out a bank loan
o pay my share of household expenses, as well as my personal expenses and attorney's fees.

Because of the low monthly income, I could only get a short-term high-interest loan that matures
next year.
As I cannot afford the expenses, including my regular medical prescription costs and autol
expenses, I asked Husband to pay me guideline spousal support of $2,502 per month. 1--1e refused.
I am therefore requesting that the Court order temporary spousal support congruous with
our respective incomes. I will be filing an updated Income and Expense Declaration concurrently
with this motion.
ATTORNEY FEES
I request the Court order Husband pay my attorney fees in the amount of $20,000.00
xxxxxxxxx
under family code section 2030. On June l, 2022, I retained
to represent m
in the above-entitled matter. Ms.
s hourly rate is $450.00 per hour and Mr. s hourly
rate is $300 per hour. I have no income beyond the Social Security benefits of $786 per month,
Husband is currently not paying me any support, and I am forced to get bank and family loans to
meet my financial obligations. I paid my attorney's fee retainer of $15,000 with the high-interest
bank loan that I need to pay off as soon as possible so that I do not incur interest on the sum.
Moreover, I--lusband not only earns more than ten times what I earn each month, but he
has continued living in the house after filing for divorce and has had limited expenses. In his
Income and Expense Declaration, Husband estimates that he pays, among other things, $700 per
month for groceries. This amount seems exaggerated because Husband does not buy that many
groceries, and the children and I spend a combined amount of about $900 per month to buy food.
Husband has also been making excessive charitable contributions of over $730 per month, and
has had access to all of his pension, savings and liquid assets. In November 2021, Husband also
received an inheritance in the amount of $25,000. On information and belief, Husband's
attorney's fees constitute a flat fee in an amount less than 50% of his one month's income.
Husband therefore has the ability to pay both his own attorney' fees and mine using his income,
savings, and inheritance funds.

REOUESTED ORDERS
I, therefore, respectfully request the court to make the following orders:
1. Husband to pay temporary guideline spousal support congruous with our earnings;
2. Husband to pay my attorney fees in the amount of $20,000.00 in accordance with Family
Code section 2030;
3. Any orders required to effectuate the above requests.
