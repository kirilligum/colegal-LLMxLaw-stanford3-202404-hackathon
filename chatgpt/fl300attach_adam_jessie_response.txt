Given the details from the conversation with Adam Jones, let's prepare an attachment for the FL-300 Request for Order and FL-158 Supporting Declaration for Attorney Fees sections tailored to his situation.

**STATISTICAL FACTS**

I am the "Petitioner/Husband" in the above-entitled matter. My wife, Jessie Jones, and I were married on March 1, 2013, and separated on December 1, 2023. The length of the marriage was ten (10) years and nine (9) months. We have two (2) minor children of the marriage, Mei and Jiro Jones. Since the separation, the children have resided with me at our family residence at 1234 Walnut Drive in Palo Alto, California. Jessie and I have lived separately since the separation. I am currently employed as the Chief Data Scientist at Colegal with a monthly salary of $5,000 and a 25% interest in the company. Jessie is employed as Chief Operating Director at GlobalSoft Inc., with a previous known income of $50,000 per month. 

**SPOUSAL SUPPORT**

Jessie and I both continue to work in our respective professions post-separation. According to my declaration, I earn a salary of $5,000 per month and have a significant equity interest in Colegal. Jessie's last known income was $50,000 per month as Chief Operating Director at GlobalSoft Inc. Though her current income is not known, it's assumed to be substantial given her high-ranking position.

Jessie and I have maintained an informal shared custody arrangement of our children, whereby they stay one week with me and one week with Jessie since our separation in December 2023. Our children, Mei and Jiro, have not faced any disruption in their living conditions and continue to attend their usual schools and activities from our family home at 1234 Walnut Drive, Palo Alto.

Given our comparable professional statuses and incomes, I believe a fair assessment of spousal support obligations and child support, if applicable, should be considered by the court, taking into account both our capacities to earn and the well-being of our children.

**ATTORNEY FEES**

I request that the Court consider our respective financial situations in relation to attorney fees. Given Jessie's significant income as Chief Operating Director at GlobalSoft Inc., it is reasonable to expect that she can contribute to her own legal expenses. I have incurred substantial legal fees since the separation in pursuit of a fair and equitable resolution to our marital dissolution, custody, and financial support arrangements. 

I have retained legal representation to navigate these proceedings, ensuring the best interests of our children are considered and to reach an amicable agreement with Jessie. Given our financial standings and the complexities involved in dividing assets, including my 25% interest in Colegal, a startup company, equitable consideration for attorney fees and costs incurred by both parties is requested.

**REQUESTED ORDERS**

I, therefore, respectfully request the court to make the following orders:
1. Equitable division of financial responsibilities, including child support and spousal support, congruous with our earnings and the needs of our children, Mei and Jiro Jones.
2. Consideration of our respective abilities to pay for our legal representation, and an order that each party bear their own attorney fees or an equitable distribution of the same, in accordance with Family Code section 2030.
3. Any orders required to effectuate the above requests, including but not limited to custody arrangements and division of property and assets.
